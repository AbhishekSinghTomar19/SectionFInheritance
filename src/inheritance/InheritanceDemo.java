    // 1. What is Inheritance?

    // Inheritance (Simple English):
    // Inheritance (noun): something that is or may be "inherited".
    // Inheritance (verb): to derive something.

    // Inheritance (verb) is the act of acquiring some physical attributes/properties/
    // behavior/traits/possessions by ONE ENTITY from ANOTHER ENTITY related to it.

    // Some examples from our daily lives:
    // 1. YOU have "inherited" (acquired) your physical attributes from YOUR PARENTS,
    // ex - hair color, color of eyes, height, ... etc.
    // 2. YOU might get some money, a house, a car, ... etc from YOUR PARENTS if they choose to.

    // Inheritance (Object-Oriented): Every entity is a class!
    // Inheritance (verb) is the mechanism by which a class can acquire
    // properties(fields/variables) and methods of another class, related to it.

    // 2. How to use Inheritance to re-use code/programs/software that is already developed and tested.
    // 3. Observe the `extends` keyword.
    // 4. What is a `super` class and what is `sub` class.
    // 5. How we can access the members of the super class from a sub class.
    // 6. Constructor Hierarchy.
    // 7. Method Overriding, Dynamic Method Dispatch, Abstract Classes & Interfaces.
    // 8. How to model our programs by using all of the concepts written above.
