# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming

## Types of Inheritance

### Simple Inheritance.  
- It typically includes a single parent class (superclass)
and a single child class (subclass).
- But, it can have more that one child classes.
- The emphasis is on the number of parent classes, i.e there should be only one parent class.

### Multi-level Inheritance.
- It typically includes a set of  
 a grand parent class (superclass of the superclass)  
 a parent class (the superclass)  
 a child class (the subclass)

### Multiple Inheritance.
- It is not allowed in Java.
We inherit properties from more than one parent class.

### Hybrid Inheritance.
Required an Abstract Class or an Interface.
 
## Types of Polymorphism

### Method Overloading
- Changing the behaviour of methods on the basis of inputs.
