# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming

## Types of Inheritance

1. Simple Inheritance.  
- It typically includes a single parent class (superclass)
and a single child class (subclass).
- But, it can have more that one child classes.
- The emphasis is on the number of parent classes, i.e there should be only one parent class.
